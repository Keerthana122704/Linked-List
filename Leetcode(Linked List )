You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.
For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.
Return the head of the modified linked list.

Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]

class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
        int sum =0;
        ListNode org =head;
        ListNode temp= head;
        head=head.next;
        while(head!=null){
            if(head.val ==0){
                temp.next=head;
                head.val=sum;
                temp=head;
                sum =0;
            }
            else       sum += head.val;
            
            head=head.next;
        }return org.next;

}

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree 
such that every key of the original BST is changed to the 
        original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

//that is 1st traverse all the right nodes(greater) then update value, go to left nodes

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
